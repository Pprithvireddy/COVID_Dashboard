In this project, I have used a front-end Javascript library called ReactJS to create a dynamic single-page application that visualizes various metrics of COVID data
fetched from an API (COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group) as a dashboard. In this project I have intergrated various front end
libraries and APIs to develop powerful application with ease.
